# Memory React

I am rewriting my [Vue memory app](https://github.com/joshclyde/memory) to be written in React.

## Design ðŸŽ¨

I have an application called Bear that is a note taking app. I like the design of it so for now am basically just copying it. Maybe eventually I'll change it up to be more specialized.

## Backlog

- unit tests
- a11y
- maybe changes what icons i am pulling in
- make the memory components forms
- probs get rid of last modified message, at least for tags
- markdown, code blocks colored for programming languages
- want to know how well I know a tag
